# ğŸ¤¯
## An anti-programming language
the compiler counts the amount of ğŸ¤¯ emojis in a .ğŸ¤¯ file and turns them into a binary output file with the number of ğŸ¤¯ as it's binary, you can add more ğŸ¤¯ to the end of the suffix to add zero-byte padding to the beginning of the file, each additional ğŸ¤¯ turns to one zero-byte at the start of the file
